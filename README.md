Loup's Guide to the Galaxy helps you navigate the planets in the mod portal. At time of writing, the majority of planets on the mod portal have some major defficiency. This modpack provides a curated collection of good planets, and explicit warnings against planets that you probably want to avoid.

# When can I use this mod?

This mod is intended for a playthrough of Space Age.

A few planets in the mod must be present at the start of the playthrough (Lignumis and Muluna). If you are in the middle of a playthrough, it is recommended that you simply download the other mods in the modpack, and use those. All other planets can be added to an ongoing playthrough of Space Age.

Lignumis is included as optional because it is a polarizing planet.

# Why is X Planet an Incompatibility?

Planets are marked as incompatibilities to denote that they should be avoided for one reason or another. Each incompatibility is listed for at least one of the following reasons: 
- **WIP**: The planet is too much of a work in progress. While most good planets have regular maintainance, some mods are too incomplete and/or in too much of a state of flux. By downloading such a planet, you are either getting an incomplete experience OR expect breaking changes to a base. e.g. Dea Dia.
- **Abandoned:** The planet was not completed, and the dev abandoned it. This planet will never be in a complete state. e.g. Janus.
- **Incomplete/Insufficient Content:** This planet lacks enough content to warrant inclusion into a playthrough.
- **Doesn't work:** The planet does not load or has major catastrophic bugs that stop it from properly functioning. These planets sometimes need companion mods made by other modders to fix issues that the original author left in the mod. e.g. Tapatrion
- **AI Slop:** This planet uses a very large amount of AI-generated assets and/or code. These planets usually suffer from one of the other major issues on this list, because the dev was not willing to stay to continue work to complete/maintain the mod. e.g. Lunar Legacy
- **Comically unbalanced:** Most planets add some powerful mechanic/tool/etc to the game which ultimately make it easier. Some mod planets are so unbalanced that they are actively detrimental to a playthrough (with other planets). e.g. Tiberium.
- **Not a planet:** Some mods listed as planets don't actually add a planet in the traditional sense to a space age playthrough. e.g. ERM Zerg.

# Why is X Planet not included?

Either the planet is:
1) Good, but not good enough for this collection. It does not suffer from the issues above, so it is not contra-indicated. e.g. Corrundum.
2) Its quality is not known enough to make a recommendation.

# Isn't this list subjective?

Yes. It comes from the collective opinions of several players who have played many modded planets. I condensed this information into one mod.
